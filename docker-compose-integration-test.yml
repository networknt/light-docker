# This is a compose file that start all depending services for mvn clean install
# in light-bot/bot-cli to build everything in develop branch.
#
# mysql, zookeeper, kafka, eventuate-cdcserver is used by light-eventuate-4j
# mysql, zookeeper, kafka, tram-cdcserver is used by light-tram-4j and light-saga-4j
# redis is used by light-session-4j
# mysql, zookeeper, kafka, eventuate-cdcserver, arango is used by light-portal
#
# Before start this compose, you should use source command to set DOCKER_HOST_IP.
#
# source set-docker-host-ip.sh
#
# If the hostname returned cannot be pinged, then you need to find out the IP
# manually with ifconfig and export it.
# for more info, please refer to https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/eventuate/getting-started/
#
# Somehow, we cannot start the tram-cdcserver in the same compose. It needs to be started
# after the integration-test is up and running. Also, we don't need eventuate-cdcserver
# for integration test.
