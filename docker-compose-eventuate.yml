# As Kafka needs your docker host name or IP, we have to set it in
# environment variable before starting this compose. Note that on
# Linux, you cannot use "./set-docker-host-ip.sh" as the variable
# is set for the child shell and the parent shell doesn't have it.
#
# You should use source instead of running it with another shell.
#
# source set-docker-host-ip.sh
